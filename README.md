## Why I did this?
In this project I'll be creating a pretty neat toy for my portfolio to flex my DOM manipulation skills. 


## What is this page?
* It's a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
* It's used to draw any thing on a custom number of sqauers by hovering the mouse on them.
* The user can insert any number of squares he wants.

## How I did it?

* As a user, I would be able to draw on a grid by hovering onto the pixels.
* I would be able to determines the number of pixels I want .
